## What I'm Working On

I enjoy applying statistical thinking and machine learning to real-world problems. My recent work focuses on:

-   Using data and algorithms responsibly, with attention to fairness and bias\
-   Exploring optimization ideas that balance performance and efficiency\
-   Building tools and workflows that make complex models more interpretable and usable

## For Fun

In my free time, I like updating my Beli account with new restaurants, working out, and watching new Netflix shows.
